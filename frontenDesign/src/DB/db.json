            "response":"Downgrade attacks in the context provided involve forcing a user equipment (UE) to connect to a lower generation cell (e.g., 4G) controlled by an attacker. This can lead to various types of attacks, such as identity requests or service rejects. These attacks can include spoofing, replaying, and tampering with control messages and data plane traffic. Downgrade attacks can also involve intercepting or manipulating MIB/SIB1 messages, initiating unicast message spoofing, fake SMS attacks in 2G networks, and other system or service level downgrades. Additionally, passive attacks like sniffing radio signals can also be used in downgrades to steal sensitive information like IMSI/SUPI."

            "response":"Confidentiality: 1. If the communication between Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMNs) is not confidentiality protected, sensitive information may be leaked to unauthorized entities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              2. Integrity: If the integrity of the data exchanged between PLMNs is not protected, the data may be modified.                                                                                                                                                               3.Control of Data Exposure: If the PLMNs don't have the ability to control the amount of data exposed and to abstract or hide network-internal aspects, sensitive data may be leaked to other entities.                                                                                                                                                               4.Protection of Exchanged Data: If exchanged data has not been adequately protected before it is shared between PLMNs, it may be subject to be leaked and abused.                                                                                                                                                                  To address these security issues, the 5G System (5GS) should support confidentiality, integrity, and replay protection for data and analytics exchange between PLMNs. It should also be able to control the amount of exposed data and abstract or hide internal network aspects based on operator policy, regulatory constraints, and roaming agreements. Additionally, certain data should have confidentiality protection while at rest based on policies."
